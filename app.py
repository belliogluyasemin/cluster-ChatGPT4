### What is Hierarchical Clustering?

Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. It can be either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down). The agglomerative approach starts with each point as its own cluster and then repeatedly merges the closest pair of clusters, whereas the divisive approach starts with one cluster and recursively splits it.

This method is particularly useful when the goal is to understand the hierarchical relationships within the data, such as grouping customers based on purchasing behavior, as we are doing here.

#### Why Ward's Method?

In this project, we have chosen to use Ward's method for hierarchical clustering. Ward's method aims to minimize the variance within each cluster, leading to the most compact and homogeneous groups possible. This is particularly effective when the goal is to identify distinct, well-separated clusters.

To evaluate the quality of these clusters, metrics such as the Davies-Bouldin Score and the Calinski-Harabasz Score are used. The Davies-Bouldin Score measures the average similarity ratio of each cluster with its most similar cluster, where a lower score indicates better clustering. The Calinski-Harabasz Score, on the other hand, evaluates the ratio of the sum of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion, with a higher score indicating a better-defined clustering structure.

# Explanation of the dendrogram
st.markdown("""
As shown in the dendrogram above, the use of Ward's method has allowed us to separate the data into distinct clusters. The hierarchical clustering approach, combined with Ward's method, ensures that the clusters are as compact as possible while maintaining distinct boundaries between them.

The vertical distance between the clusters indicates the dissimilarity between them, and the large jumps seen here are a strong indicator that the data naturally separates into well-defined clusters. This visual evidence supports the validity of our clustering approach.
